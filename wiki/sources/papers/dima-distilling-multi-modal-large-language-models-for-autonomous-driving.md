## Overview

DiMA addresses the core tension in autonomous driving between vision-based planners (efficient but fragile on rare scenarios) and LLM-based approaches (strong reasoning but prohibitively expensive at inference). Rather than choosing one paradigm, DiMA bridges them through knowledge distillation: it jointly trains a vision-based planner alongside a multi-modal LLM, then discards the LLM at inference time, retaining only the efficient planner that has absorbed the LLM's reasoning capabilities.

The key innovation is joint training rather than post-hoc distillation. The vision-based scene encoder is trained simultaneously with the MLLM through four tasks: visual question answering, trajectory estimation, KL-divergence-based knowledge distillation, and three surrogate tasks (masked token reconstruction, future token prediction, and scene editing). The BEAM token representation structures the scene into BEV, ego-vehicle, agent, and map components, providing explicit modeling of driving scene elements.

DiMA achieves 37% reduction in L2 trajectory error, 80% reduction in collision rate, and 44% improvement in long-tail scenarios compared to vision-only baselines on nuScenes. Critically, at inference the system runs as a lightweight vision planner with no LLM overhead.

## Key Contributions

- Joint training framework that distills MLLM reasoning into a vision planner during training, discarding the LLM at inference for zero additional cost
- BEAM token structured representation (BEV + Ego + Agent + Map) providing explicit scene decomposition for distillation
- Three surrogate tasks that enhance representation learning: masked token reconstruction, future token prediction, and counterfactual scene editing
- 80% collision rate reduction and 44% improvement on long-tail scenarios (overtaking, three-point turns) vs vision-only baselines
- Demonstrates that the efficiency-vs-reasoning tradeoff can be resolved through distillation rather than architectural compromise

The framework has two components during training:

**Vision-Based Planner (retained at inference):**
- Scene encoder producing structured BEAM tokens
- Planning transformer for trajectory generation

**Multi-Modal LLM (discarded at inference):**
- LLaVA-v1.5-7B language model base processing structured BEAM representations through adapter layers
- Handles four training objectives:

1. **Visual Question Answering:** Scene understanding through language
2. **Trajectory Estimation:** Direct planning supervision
3. **Knowledge Distillation:** KL divergence minimization between MLLM and planner hidden features, aligning internal representations
4. **Surrogate Tasks:**
   - *Masked token reconstruction:* Reconstruct randomly masked BEAM tokens (forces robust encoding)
   - *Future token prediction:* Forecast future scene states (temporal reasoning)
   - *Scene editing:* Add/remove agents to teach counterfactual reasoning about hypothetical scenarios

**BEAM Token Structure:**
- **B**EV tokens: map and spatial layout
- **E**go tokens: autonomous vehicle state
- **A**gent tokens: surrounding dynamic objects
- **M**ap tokens: additional road elements

Training uses nuScenes for open-loop planning and DriveLM plus generated QA pairs for VQA-style supervision; the appendix describes a two-stage AdamW training setup.

## Results

### nuScenes Planning Benchmark

| Model | Type | L2 Error (m) | Collision Rate (%) |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| UniAD | Vision E2E | -- | -- |
| VAD | Vision E2E | baseline | baseline |
| PARA-Drive | LLM-based | -- | -- |
| TOKEN-Drive | LLM-based | -- | -- |
| **DiMA** | **Distilled** | **-37% vs VAD** | **-80% vs VAD** |

### Long-Tail Scenarios

| Scenario | DiMA L2 (m) | VAD L2 (m) | Improvement |
|----------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Overtaking | 0.66 | 1.06 | -37.7% |
| Three-point turn | 1.05 | 1.57 | -33.1% |
| Overall long-tail | -- | -- | -44% |

DiMA also demonstrates VQA capabilities enabling language-guided scene reasoning, improving interpretability and allowing users to query system decisions -- though this requires the MLLM to be present (inference-time option for debugging).

## Limitations & Open Questions

- The distillation framework requires training with a full 7B MLLM, increasing training cost even though inference is cheap -- this limits rapid iteration
- Evaluated on nuScenes open-loop metrics only; closed-loop evaluation would better validate the long-tail improvements
- Whether the BEAM token decomposition generalizes beyond nuScenes-style urban driving (e.g., highway, rural, construction zones) is untested
